CMPE297 Assignment 1:
II. Steps to add a new syscall for linux kernel version 2.6.34.13
1.Add ".long sys_helloworld" at the end of the file syscall_table_32.S under arch/x86/kernel
2.Add "#define __NR_helloworld 338" at the end of the list in arch/x86/include/asm/unistd_32.h.  Increment NR_syscalls to 339
3.implement helloworld syscall in /arch/x86/kernel/sys_i386_32.c
  #include <linux/linkage.h>

  asmlinkage int sys_helloworld() {
   printk(KERN_EMERG "Hello World!\n");
   return 0;
  }

III. Steps to add a new hypercall to Xen hypervisor 4.2.0
1. add a new entry in xen/arch/x86/x86_32/entry.S
2. define a new number for the new hypercall in xen/include/public/xen.h
3. implement the new hypercall

Applications running on guest OS makes a system call to Xen hypervisor. Then Xen hypervisor passes the control back to guest OS.
Guest OS will use hypercalls to hypervisor to request privileged operations.  This mechanism adds one level of indirection
comparing to native application requesting privileged operations via syscall to OS has a small
penalty on the speed due to the extra layer of indirection.
